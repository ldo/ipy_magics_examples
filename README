This repository contains [Jupyter](http://jupyter.org/) notebooks that demonstrate the use of my `ipy_magics` modules ([GitHub](https://github.com/ldo/ipy_magics),  [GitLab](https://gitlab.com/ldo/ipy_magics)). You will need them installed somewhere in order to run these notebooks; at the beginning of each notebook is a cell containing `%run` commands that may need to be edited with the right paths to find the modules. Alternatively, if you copy or symlink them to the right place, these commands can be invoked as is.
